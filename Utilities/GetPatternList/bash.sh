#*?, +?, ??
#The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isnâ€™t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against '<H1>title</H1>', it will match the entire string, and not just '<H1>'. Adding '?' after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using .*? in the previous expression will match only '<H1>'.
